                    <p>Hello there, thank you for taking the time to try and get to know me. My name is Tselot Million, and I am currently a twenty year old software engineering student at Addis Ababa University. I am striving to graduate with a good GPA while honing my skills as a creative web designer and app developer. Currently, I am in my third year, learning my first semester.</p>
                    <p>Ever since I joined this department, I have discovered a deep passion for programming. Although I am relatively new to the world of coding, I have quickly realized that I have a knack for creating problem-solving algorithms. Designing codes that simplify implementations and make processes more efficient has become an exciting challenge that I eagerly embrace.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my studies, I have taken several courses that have significantly contributed to my understanding of software engineering. These courses have provided me with a strong foundation in various programming languages and technologies, enhancing my technical skills and fostering a creative approach to solving complex problems.</p>

                    <p class="homefix2">In addition to my coursework, I have participated in several group projects held at my school. These projects have given me invaluable experience in collaboration and teamwork, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. Working with my peers to develop innovative solutions has been incredibly rewarding and has further solidified my passion for software development.</p>

            <div class="rbox">
                <p>One of the aspects I find most fulfilling about software development is the ability to bring ideas to life. Whether it's designing a user-friendly web interface or developing a functional app, the process of turning concepts into reality is incredibly rewarding. My experiences so far have reinforced my determination to become a proficient software system developer in Africa.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, I am confident that the opportunities available to me will play a crucial role in helping me achieve my goals. I am eager to contribute to the African tech community and be part of the transformation that technology is bringing to the continent. My dedication to problem-solving and my passion for coding will undoubtedly be assets to any vibrant tech community. Thank you once again for considering my application.</p>
